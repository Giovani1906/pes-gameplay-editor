# Contribution Rules
## Python Style
- All files should be formatted using the [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) auto-formatter.\
  Otherwise, follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- Variable names should be written in snake_case.\
  With the exception being the functions located in `pes_ai.<pes_version>.<file>` that maps the sections of the PES' binary files, which should follow the `map_<sectionName>` format.
